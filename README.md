# Iris Dataset Analysis
## Overview
The Iris Dataset Analysis project is a beginner-friendly machine learning project that aims to provide insights into the famous Iris dataset. The dataset contains information about the petal and sepal sizes of three different species of iris flowers. By implementing a machine learning algorithm, we aim to analyze the dataset and gain valuable insights into the characteristics of each iris species.

# Dataset
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and consists of the following attributes:

1. Sepal length (cm)
2. Sepal width (cm)
3. Petal length (cm)
4. Petal width (cm)
5. Class (Species of iris flower)
The dataset contains 150 rows, with each row representing one iris flower instance. There are three classes (species) in the dataset, with 50 instances for each class.

## Requirements
To run the project, you will need the following:

1. Python (version 3.x)
2. Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
3. Required Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
## Implementation
1. Data Exploration: Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset. Explore features such as distributions, correlations, and summary statistics.

2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (if any), and scaling numerical features if necessary.

3. Feature Engineering: Perform feature selection or extraction techniques to identify the most informative features for model training.

4. Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for classification tasks. Common algorithms for this type of dataset include:

## Logistic Regression
1. Decision Trees
2. Random Forests
3. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) for my case I used K-Nearest neighbours(KNN) model
Model Training: Train the selected machine learning model using the preprocessed dataset.

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure robustness of the results.

6. Insights Generation: Analyze the model's predictions and generate insights into the characteristics of each iris species based on the model's decision boundaries and feature importances.
